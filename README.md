Migrate 2 WP
================

Migrate your static files to Wordpress
------------------

This repo is based on Bobby CMS, which is in development.

The basic function of this code is to first crawl an old site, then clean up the html, then manually connect old pages to new pages in Wordpress, and end it all with pushing the clean code straight into Wordpress.

Until 1.0 is reached it's highly recommended to not use this code without proper backups of your database.
